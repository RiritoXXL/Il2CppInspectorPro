# Il2CppInspector Pro 2024
Il2CppInspector helps you to reverse engineer IL2CPP applications, providing the most complete analysis currently available.

This is a continuation of Il2CppInspector by [@djkaty](https://github.com/djkaty/Il2CppInspector), which has suspended development. This version includes new features and support for additional metadata versions, with the latest update from [@lukefz.](https://github.com/LukeFZ)

Currently, I'm focused on further expanding the tool's capabilities by integrating custom helper files into the il2cpp C++ scaffold. These enhancements aim to streamline the reverse engineering process, making it easier to work with and analyze il2cpp projects."
